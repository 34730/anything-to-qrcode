Anything-to-QRcode Google Chrome Extension
==========================================

This is a fork of Anything to QRcode extension for Google Chrome by indoorsman. 
Anything to QRcode works absolute locally and offline, without any ads or tracking.
Extension Anything to QRcode creates QRcode from the url of current page, any text/image/link in the page, etc.

The new version has a more simplified and clean user interface and an enlarged QR-code pictogram for high-resolution screens.
